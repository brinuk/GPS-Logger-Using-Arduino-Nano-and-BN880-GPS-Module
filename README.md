# GPS-Logger-Using-Arduino-Nano-and-BN880-GPS-Module

This logger uses an Arduino Nano, a BN880 or BN220 GPS module and an SD Card Reader/Write. All housed in an small 3d printed box. The logger writes a KML file to the SD card containing the GPS co-ordinates and altitude relative to the start point. The SD card when removed and inserted into a computer will display the logged track on Google Earth. The video shows the detail of the unit, the wiring of the components, the contents of the SD card and a Google Earth plot of the recorded track.
