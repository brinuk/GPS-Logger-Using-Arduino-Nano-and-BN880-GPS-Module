# GPS-Logger-Using-Arduino-Nano-and-BN880-GPS-Module

This logger uses an Arduino Nano, a BN880 or BN220 GPS module and an SD Card Reader/Write. All housed in an small 3d printed box.
The logger writes a KML file to the SD card containing the GPS co-ordinates. The SD card when removed and inserted into a computer will display the logged track on Google Earth.
